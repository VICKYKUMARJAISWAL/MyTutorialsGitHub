Go to properties of project with the build error (right click > Properties)

View the "Libraries" tab in the "Build Path" section

Find the "JRE System Library" in the list (if this is missing then this error message is not an eclipse bug but a mis-configured project)

Remove the "JRE System Library"

Hit "Add Library ...", Select "JRE System Library" and add the appropriate JRE for the project (eg. 'Workspace default JRE')

Hit "Finish" in the library selection and "OK" in the project properties and then wait for the re-build of the project
